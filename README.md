RocketSim
=========

A simulation for calculating the apogee height of a water/air rocket. Useful for breaking the world record.

## Use
Configure main.py with the default values of the rocket. Make sure to include anything in the comments. 
Nothing is optional.

## Info
This simulation calculates the thrust profile, and apogee height of a water/compressed air rocket given by the configuration given. 

As of yet, the rocket does not support fins and does not provide the magnitudes of aerodynamic forces that act during flight.

This project was an end-of-the-year homework assignment. As such it was developed in a rush and *may* produce inaacurrate results. The maths have not been checked yet. You have been warned.
