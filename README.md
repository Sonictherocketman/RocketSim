RocketSim
=========

A simulation for calculating the apogee height of a water/air rocket. Useful for breaking the world record.

## Use
Configure main.py with the default values of the rocket. Make sure to include anything in the comments. 
Nothing is optional.

## Info
This simulation calculates the thrust profile, and apogee height of a water/compressed air rocket given by the configuration given. 

As of yet, the rocket does not support fins and does not provide the magnitudes of aerodynamic forces that act during flight.
